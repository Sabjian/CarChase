# Road Chase Game - Design Document

## Game Overview

### Core Concept
A top-down driving game where players navigate randomly generated road networks while being pursued by an AI car that uses line-of-sight mechanics to track and chase the player.

### Genre
Action/Arcade Driving Game

### Development Environment
Godot 4.4

### Target Platform
PC (Windows, macOS, Linux) with potential web export

### Target Audience
Casual gamers who enjoy simple, replayable arcade experiences

## Core Gameplay

### Player Objectives
- **Primary Goal**: Survive as long as possible while being chased
- **Secondary Goals**: 
  - Explore the procedurally generated road network
  - Break line of sight to lose the AI pursuer
  - Potentially collect items or reach checkpoints (optional)

### Core Mechanics
1. **Vehicle Control**: Basic car movement (accelerate, brake, turn)
2. **Procedural Road Generation**: Random road layouts for each playthrough
3. **AI Line-of-Sight Chase**: AI car pursues when player is visible
4. **Stealth/Evasion**: Player must break line of sight to escape

## Technical Specifications

### Map Generation
- **Road Network**: Procedurally generated using algorithms like:
  - Grid-based road placement with random connections
  - Perlin noise for organic road curves
  - Minimum spanning tree for connected road network
- **Map Size**: Finite but large enough for interesting gameplay (e.g., 100x100 grid units)
- **Road Types**: Single lane roads with intersections
- **Obstacles**: Buildings, trees, or barriers that block line of sight

### AI Behavior
- **Detection Range**: Fixed radius around AI car (e.g., 50 units)
- **Line of Sight**: Raycasting to check if player is visible
- **Chase State**: When player is detected, AI follows optimal path
- **Search State**: When line of sight is broken, AI searches last known position
- **Idle State**: AI patrols roads randomly when player not detected

### Physics & Movement
- **Vehicle Physics**: Simple arcade-style movement
  - Acceleration/deceleration
  - Turning radius based on speed
  - Collision detection with road boundaries
- **Camera**: Top-down view following player vehicle

## Game States & Flow

### Game States
1. **Menu**: Start game, settings, instructions
2. **Playing**: Main gameplay loop
3. **Caught**: Player caught by AI (game over)
4. **Paused**: Game paused by player

### Gameplay Loop
1. Game starts with player spawned on random road
2. AI car spawned at distant location
3. Player drives around road network
4. AI detects player and begins chase
5. Player attempts to break line of sight
6. Loop continues until player is caught or quits

## Visual Design

### Art Style
- **Perspective**: Top-down 2D view
- **Style**: Minimalist geometric shapes or simple pixel art
- **Color Scheme**: High contrast for visibility
  - Roads: Dark gray/black
  - Player car: Bright color (blue, green)
  - AI car: Contrasting color (red, orange)
  - Obstacles: Neutral colors (brown, gray)

### UI Elements
- **HUD**: 
  - Survival timer
  - Speed indicator (optional)
  - Mini-map showing immediate area (optional)
- **Visual Feedback**:
  - Line of sight indicator (optional debug feature)
  - AI detection state (color changes, icons)

## Audio Design

### Sound Effects
- Engine sounds for both vehicles
- Tire screeching on turns
- Alert sound when AI detects player
- Collision/crash sounds

### Music
- Tension-building background music
- Dynamic audio that intensifies during chase sequences

## Technical Implementation

### Core Systems
1. **Map Generator**: Creates random road networks using TileMap
2. **Vehicle Controller**: Handles player input and CharacterBody2D physics
3. **AI System**: Manages AI behavior states using Navigation2D pathfinding
4. **Line of Sight System**: RayCast2D for visibility detection
5. **Game Manager**: Handles game states and scoring using signals

## Godot-Specific Implementation

### Engine Features to Utilize
- **Scene System**: Separate scenes for main menu, game world, and UI
- **Navigation2D**: For AI pathfinding on the road network
- **RayCast2D**: For line-of-sight detection
- **TileMap**: For road generation and collision detection
- **CharacterBody2D**: For vehicle physics and collision
- **GDScript**: Primary scripting language for game logic
